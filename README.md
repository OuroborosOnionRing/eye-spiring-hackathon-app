# eye-spiring-hackathon-app
2 man job for a 24 hour hackathon
Raw demo made in 12 hours with javascript in the webapp to emulate a mobile application

made with html, css, javascript and python

flask servers

due to it being a one day hackathon, we made a webapp to emulate a phone app
To see it as it is intended, open the server, and scale it horizontally until the navigation bad options cannot be seen and all that is available is the menu icon. 

We added a non-working chat function and a dummy checkout page

we revamped the product listing to allow for ease of filtering of products based on needs. Total uphaul of app UIUX and revamping of menus and buttons. 

The main idea was to bridge connectivity betwwen eyecare providers and clients
